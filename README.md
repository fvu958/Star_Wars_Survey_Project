Star Wars Survey Project

A project using survey data from individuals surveyed before Star Wars: The Force Awakens using advanced data cleaning to clean and analyze the survey data

Quick observations:
- The original trilogy was viewed more than the 2nd trilogy that followed
- This obviously means, and is backed by what I analyzed and general sentiment, that the original trilogy is very popular
- Not surprisingly, men watched the 2nd trilogy more than women did. Interestingly, men disliked the 2nd trilogy far more than women did
